// Tests the speed of various amounts of points of various stamp sizes.

// Test the speed of calling the heatmap point adding function once for
// every single point (a la glVertex3f) vs. calling one function which
// adds a whole buffer of points (a la glVertexPointer). Basically, time
// the function call overhead.
