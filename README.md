# HeatmapGenerator
HeatmapGenerator is a graphical user interface software program written in C++, R, and OpenGL to create customized gene expression heatmaps from RNA-seq and microarray data in medical research. HeatmapGenerator can also be used to make heatmaps in a variety of other non-medical fields.

HeatmapGenerator is peer-reviewed published software (http://www.scfbm.org/content/9/1/30). When using this software, please cite: [Khomtchouk et al.: “HeatmapGenerator: High performance RNAseq and microarray visualization software suite to examine differential gene expression levels using an R and C++ hybrid computational pipeline.” Source Code for Biology and Medicine, 2014 9:30].
