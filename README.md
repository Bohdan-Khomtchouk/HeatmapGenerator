# HeatmapGenerator
HeatmapGenerator is a graphical user interface software program written in C++, R, and OpenGL to create customized gene expression heatmaps from RNA-seq and microarray data in medical research. HeatmapGenerator can also be used to make heatmaps in a variety of other non-medical fields.

HeatmapGenerator is peer-reviewed published software (http://www.scfbm.org/content/9/1/30).
