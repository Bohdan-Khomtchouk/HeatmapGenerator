# HeatmapGenerator-Electron

This is an Electron app version of HeatmapGenerator combined with shinyheatmap (Bohdan-Khomtchouk/HeatmapGenerator, Bohdan-Khomtchouk/shinyheatmap). We used r-shiny-electron by Dirk Schumacher (dirkschumacher/r-shiny-electron) to help us with the Electron application development and packaging.

This repo is missing 2 folders: "r-mac" and "node_modules", which can both be downloaded from dirkschumacher/r-shiny-electron and placed in the main directory.
